He is always able to exploit the space at his disposal in a dynamic and breathtaking way (the sequence of the escape on the trolley through the mine tunnels is memorable). Here, however, the ""insolent"" lightness in its artificiality is lacking a little, which characterized the first episode and the game is a bit repetitive."^3^4^2^3^0^PG^Action & Adventure, Children & Family Movies, Classic Movies^Indiana Jones, his young sidekick and a spoiled songbird get more than they bargained for when they go to India in search of a missing magical stone.^Movie^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^1

He frees his father and together they go to Berlin, sneaking into a gathering chaired by Hitler. Then the adventure continues in the Middle East.^The allegorical values ??are hidden in the folds of an action with a frenzied rhythm and hilarious gags, with a great idea: to put Indy in front of the parent, the elderly Dr. Jones. The father-son duet, also thanks to the winking Sean Connery, is extraordinary. In short, this film is even better than the other two previous ones, especially for the declared desire not to take oneself seriously and to laugh at everything.^3^4^2^3^1^PG-13^Action & Adventure, Children & Family Movies, Classic Movies^Accompanied by his father, Indiana Jones sets off on his third adventure to explore the cradle of civilization on a perilous hunt for the Holy Grail.^Movie^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^1

Rocky loves, loved back, the young Adriana and this, at the moment, is the biggest stroke of luck of his life. The second comes when the famous champion Apollo Creed, left without a challenger, decides to give Rocky a chance. It is the first episode of the successful series, winner of three Oscars: film, direction, editing. In fact, it is a very pleasant film, where you shamelessly cheer for a Stallone who is still young and thin, full of will and good feelings. The best part of the film, rather than the almost obvious final fight, is where our hero prepares for combat. It is here, among other things, that the steadycam was used for the first time (to follow Stallone jogging on the stairs).^^1^4^3^3^0^PG^Action & Adventure, Classic Movies, Dramas^Sylvester Stallone shot to fame as Rocky Balboa, an unknown fighter who's given a shot at fighting world champ Apollo Creed as a publicity stunt.^Movie^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1

At the end of a terrible match, Rocky will prevail, but his words after the victory will be only of peace.^"The structure of the story is elementary, the passions at stake primary, Balboa is a champion all home, ring and good feelings, a messenger of the ""pax americana"" on Russian soil. Stallone's Reagan period film, makes good Rocky the necessary counterpart to the grim Rambo. The boxer is now a real myth of Western propaganda. Stallone's direction aims to dramatically emphasize this clash. But now, in the fourth episode, the soup is overcooked. Emphasis is not enough to replace the rhythm of Avildsen's direction.

It is in the irruption of abnormality into normality that Schlesinger reveals the author's sure hand: the beautiful opening sequence, of a day like all others broken by the murder (which the mother hears on the phone), the tension accumulated by daily details that the foreground makes menacing, a walk to the botanical garden that takes the step of the nightmare. For Schlesinger, the fable of family serenity always borders on horror, even in the choice (moral or not?)

And that's exactly why it works; provided, of course, the premises are respected and the effects are satisfactory. ""Dante's Peak"", on the other hand, shoots away the best effects during the opening credits, does not make us in the least fond of its characters and reduces the effects to a lot of smoke (and almost no roast).

Yet ""The Game"" doesn't work; from a certain point on we don't care that much to know if it is fiction or reality and, all in all, the story takes the pace of the usual ""action"" succession.

Of course, in _Jackie Brown_ there are still his typical traits, but, on the other hand, there is also the obstinacy to keep his sudden outbursts of violence out of scope and to expand the space granted to the characters, often filmed in almost fixed, while they chat and chat, up to paradoxical limits. And his ability to ""mistcast"" celebrity actors reaches its peak here, with De Niro's taciturn, buzzed and smoked ex-inmate and vapid blonde late flower daughter Bridget Fonda. But of course the film is all by Pam Grier, mature and combative, on whose imposing profile the camera is fixed in the opening sequence, very long and virtually immobile.

Difficult to do Scorsese if you do not have his sense of tragedy and his tight stylistic rigor: so ""Blow"" ends up flattening out in a narrative that runs towards a foregone conclusion, showing us nothing but a wretch who has had his life ruined ( repeatedly) by an ignoble mother and treacherous friends."^0^3^2^2^1^R^Dramas^Cocaine smuggler George rises from poverty to become one of the biggest drug dealers in America before his eventual downfall.^Movie^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0

The temptation is strong and the man is not of stone and finds himself managing the blow with an old fence and a young rampant of his profession, with which some ""misunderstanding"" arises."^"Sometimes the cinema seems to function like the world of football where a team full of stars does not always win the championship, especially if the amalgam is missing, which some ""rich"" president believed was the name of a great player. ""The Score"" confirms this law and despite putting in the field the best of three generations of actors, Brando, De Niro and Norton, who just by writing them arouses fear, in the end the mountain gives birth to a medium-sized mouse. Frank Oz, an appreciated comedian with a pinch of madness, tries his hand at thriller and, all in all, he's not bad at telling the latest shot of a great burglar, a plot that has made the genre so successful.

But fate has a new case in store for him: in a Washington pension, little Megan Rose - daughter of a movie star and a senator - has been kidnapped. All the clues seem to point to Gary Soneji, one of his professors. Jezzie, the policewoman who should have supervised the girl, is harshly taken back by her superiors, who are right next to Alex ...^Alex Cross, former protagonist of _The collector_ by Gary Fleder (1998) is back: this time not with a serial killer, but with a megalomaniac kidnapper and exhibitionist who wants to emulate one of the most famous kidnappings of the century (that of the son of Charles Lindberg, the flyer of the Atlantic). Subtracks and counterplots confuse the story a lot and make the atmosphere fluctuating: but this could be a problem in the James Patterson novel from which the film is based, since even _The collector_ suffered from too many twists and turns in the narrative. However, Freeman is so good that his glance is enough to suggest restlessness and implications: his Cross enters by right among the cinematic cops to remember; and the direction of the New Zealander Tamahori is solid, with moments of effective tension (the sequence before the titles, the staging in front of the Russian embassy, ??the race for the delivery of the ransom).^1^2^1^2^1^R^Thrillers^When a girl is kidnapped from a prestigious prep school, a homicide detective takes the case, teaming up with young security agent.^Movie^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0

The mission must last a few minutes; instead it lasts for eighteen hours of iron and fire. Two Black Hawk helicopters are shot down and the survivors are rescued ...^"It is not their war (of the Americans), but we know that in the cinema war is war, which is fought above all for the spirit of the body and that the rangers' code commits never to abandon a comrade in the hands of the enemy. Hot material, this episode of recent history; especially if entrusted to a producer like Jerry Buckheimer, who does not have a light hand with militarist rhetoric (and not even with the cinematographic one, on the other hand ...). But Ridley Scott's solid British ""militarism"" and great spectacular energy save Black Hawk Down. Elementary on the ideological level (but often war films are, or even must be), it has the merit of concentrating for two full and incessant hours on military action: which is hard, frenetic, immersed in blood, dust, danger, in explosions.

A countess, a hero of the First World War, an idol of the crowds and the American producer of the Charlie Chan films are the guests who flock to the mansion. Everything seems to be going well, until a murder is committed.^Playing on an original screenplay that mimics a play, Altman throws himself among his characters, hooks them, stalks them, forces them to reveal, almost always, the worst of themselves. Closed in the unity of place (the villa) and time (two days), _Gosford Park_ is very reminiscent of _A marriage_, especially in the first part, in its ups and downs around the house, to discover a face, a betrayal, a vice, a sympathy , to weave the web of a universe that seems trapped in itself like that of the Corelli family. For once, only the people of cinema (the star Ivor Novello and the Hollywood producer) seem to have a glimmer of vitality, and perhaps the head waitress Elsie who, however, decides to try to change her life. For others, only the surface play and the deep hatred that govern coexistence between classes and within the same class is valid. Of course, he is not the greatest Altman, a bit ragged especially in the second part; but there are very few authors who know how to guide such a set (36 characters: 14 gentlemen, on the upper floors, 20 servants on the lower floors) with such lightness.

It is clear that in that ""panic room"" there is the whole of America, numb after 9/11 by a phobia that comes from within and without. David Fincher is a talented director and he proves it in the only exceptional sequence: Jodie sees the intruders from the closed circuit screen but reacts only when she ""hears"" the sound of a ball hit by accident by one of the bad guys.

Each blow exhibits or hides its wounds, each race counts its dead and each city its craters and cemeteries.

All the more reason, in the case of a Hollywood blockbuster, imagined, written, shot and launched to be a summer blockbuster, this laborious ""betrayal"" has to stick more to the conventions of one ""genre"" than to another. As usual, the hand of the Teutonic Petersen is not the lightest, but in the end the result holds: faithful to the narrative economy, the star mix, the simple structural lines, the dialogues, the rhythms of the ""peplum"" (which is has always been considered by most critics to be a minor trend, a low practice in the mosaic of artisanal cinema production).

Dick, The Golden Man, written in the 1950s, but the themes of fate and the hunted mutant are well known and have given better results (Minority Report, just to stay with Dick). The only two reasons to see Next are therefore Julianne Moore, always gorgeous, and a cameo by Peter Falk, adorable but tainted with a New Millennium Hollywood-style anti-smoking joke.^1^2^0^2^0^PG-13^Action & Adventure, Sci-Fi & Fantasy^Las Vegas magician Cris can see a few minutes into the future and an FBI agent wants his help thwarting a nuclear attack.^Movie^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1

The news they find to welcome them is not good at all: the American government suspects Jones of being in league with the Russians and intends to get him fired from the university. However, a perspective opens up thanks to the meeting with the young Mutt, who asks Indiana to accompany him on a dangerous and unclear mission in search of a legendary object: the Crystal Skull of Akator, around which myths and superstitions intertwine. The two thus travel to Peru where they will have to face numerous vicissitudes, complicated by the fact that even the Soviets, led by the glacial spy Irina Spalko, are in search of the precious find.^"Politically correct adventurona, almost bloodless, where the strongest insult is ""son of a bitch"" and where no animals are killed, the fourth chapter of Indiana Jones has its most significant novelties in the 50s setting, in which it peeps out McCarthyism, and in the character of the young Mutt (name that means mongrel), played by Shia LaBeouf who enters the scene tanned as Marlon Brando in the Wild. In the era of 300, Speed ??Racer and Beowulf it is a pleasure to review the hand of man in mechanically complex scenographies and so, even if perhaps a bit of pathos is missing and the various puzzles are solved in a hurry, we are witnessing the latest adventure of Indiana Jones with a smile, between nostalgic and perpetually amazed on the lips."^3^4^2^3^1^PG-13^Action & Adventure, Children & Family Movies, Sci-Fi & Fantasy^Indiana Jones is drawn into a Russian plot to unearth the Crystal Skulls of Akator, Amazonian artifacts with supernatural powers.^Movie^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^1

Yet this time, the formula has an edge. The presence of a director of the caliber of Rob Reiner can be felt, and enjoyed in seeing the two Oscars, as usual very good, on the same scene. There is also time to laugh (Freeman is the shoulder, Nicholson the comic talent), and to breathe the scent of poetry at times.

Limits that have harnessed the Danish Lone Scherfig to the point of almost nullifying her hand: the author of An Education has little more than grace in directing the actors. Just as Emma and Dexter touch each other without (almost) ever grasping each other, so the camera engages in an eternal and delicate courtship, too polite, to the screenplay (signed by Nicholls himself).

Young mare Devon, a British cavalry officer, a German soldier and a French grandfather with her granddaughter will find comfort and benefit from being close to Joey.^The human co-stars remain on the screen for a few minutes, and no one leaves their mark (except the great Niels Arestrup): Spielberg stages them with theatrical precision (the film is based on the novel by Michael Morpurgo but also on the play that is derivative), on fordian backgrounds, but his heart beats only for Joey.

The novel of the same name by Englishman Allison Pearson was a successful example of pink literature with healthy injections of British humor, a la Bridget Jones.

All that remains for him is to ask for help from his family, allowing himself to be hosted in rotation by his sisters, whose lives will be thrown into chaos and turmoil.^"Jesse Peretz's film is a light comedy about the search - possible - for a place in the world. Even with the disastrous premises embodied by Paul Rudd: obtuse but gentle, rustic but peaceful, pathologically sincere, he is the soul and body of a polite and optimistic work.

Escaped from the clutches of the former, who had captured him, John meets Princess Dejah (Lynn Collins), who desperately needs to find a savior for her kingdom of red Martians, and has agreed to put his forces in the service of a new and epic conflict.^"Andrew Stanton treats the muscular hero like a cartoon, and in the best sequences the rock-hard veteran Southerner becomes, in the director's hands, a puppet tossed about by weightlessness and green alien barbarians. Unfortunately, Stanton rarely manages to bring out his playful and amused vein: the romantic subplot, which includes grueling explanations on the modalities of ""teleportation"" of Carter from Earth to Mars, plunges the film into boredom (also due to two interpreters without charisma) and the imagery evoked (from Conan the barbarian to Prince of Persia.

But the melancholy kindness of the expressions of ""Ratatouille"" remains a mirage and in the face of the little Turbo, no matter how bungling and likeable, the spark, fundamental in an animation, does not go off, which transforms the freak into ""one of us"" and at the same time exalts it as being unique.

Also thanks to the translucent setting of the 70s, the film involves without seeking forced or false aesthetic originality but remaining functional to one thing: fear.

One day Curtis, one of the poor, decides that the time has come to change the state of things.^"To bring this powerful dystopia to the big screen, Bong Joon-ho exploits with fulminating and visionary skill the two risky ""cages"" that he inherits from the source material: that of the comic from which the film is based (Le Transperceneige by Jean-Marc Rochette and Jacques Lob) and that, even more rigid, of the convoy, consisting of a series of individual sets (reconstructed in the studio in Prague) that mechanically mark the action. The camera moves with unprecedented freedom in the hyper-technological but narrow spaces of the train and, like a ram breaking through the doors of the wagons, Bong's direction eludes the constraints in which his characters move. The entertainment whizzes by without brakes, an adrenaline-pumping show whose political load seems obvious from the beginning, but unfolds in progressive revelations until it reaches the very black and slave heart of the locomotive, the very meaning of revolution. With the finale, colder than any blanket of snow, Snowpiercer breaks down the boundaries of genre cinema to show us the terminus of humanity."^1^3^2^2^0^R^Action & Adventure, Cult Movies, International Movies^The Earth's remaining inhabitants are confined to a single train circling the globe as revolution brews among the class-divided cars.^Movie^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^1

Among the various encounters there are those with the Turin nobleman and his university daughter, who live in a studio flat on the edge of the Raccordo; with the ""palmologist"" who obsessively seeks a remedy to free the plants of his oasis from devouring larvae; with the new prince doing early morning gymnastics on the roof of his castle built in the abusive heart of the north-eastern suburbs; with the actor of photo novels, historical memory of Rome in the cinema, who obstinately pursues the fame and dream of a young adventure on the junction, like the eel fisherman who built a village on the water under the overpasses of southern Rome."^"Thanks to a calculated and at the same time natural writing, born from the relationship between the director, the crew reduced to the bone and the characters who simply live their lives in front of the camera, the Raccordo becomes a sacred place because it is universal, a no man's land that it is reborn starting from a displacement and waiting for a revelation. Author of a cinema of the real, Rosi blurs the very concept of documentary and as a recognition for a cinema based on research and observation that has existed in Italy for some time, the Golden Lion in Venice 70 at ""Sacro GRA"" is not a surprise or a revolution, but the culmination of a movement that counts other directors (Di Costanzo, Oliviero, Marcello, to stay with the best known) and that now has the sole task of continuing to make the real Italian cinema we need."^1^1^3^0^1^TV-MA^Documentaries, International Movies^Italian filmmaker Gianfranco Rosi turns his eye to his own country, roaming and filming for over two years in a minivan on Rome's giant ring road.^Movie^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^1^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0^0

373^5 Flights Up^2014^Drama^92^6.0^6.4^6.0^Young painter Alex Carver bought a rundown, two-bedroom apartment in the Brooklyn suburbs of New York for him and his wife Ruth. After 40 years, the neighborhood has become fashionable and their little apartment is worth a small fortune. Ruth (Diane Keaton), now a retired teacher, and Alex (Morgan Freeman) who still paints, are always as in love as on the first day. They allow Ruth's granddaughter, real estate agent Lily (Cynthia Nixon), to put their house up for sale to see what they can get out of it. Facing the unexpected and a bizarre group of would-be buyers, Ruth and Alex begin to wonder if their lives should be drastically changed.^This Ruth & Alex (actually based on a novel) could also be a theatrical piece, set in a few rooms and some fleeting New York exterior, a bourgeois comedy with calm tones that, in the sly subtraction tests by Diane Keaton and Morgan Freeman, it seems to make fun of the rhythms and cynicism of certain contemporary cinema. Embodied by the hyperkinetic niece Cynthia Nixon, who is entrusted with the sale of her beloved apartment and the search for a new home. In the real estate frenzy, husband and wife devoted to each other seem impermeable and ironically disinterested.
